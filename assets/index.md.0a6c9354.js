In the case of jump king a good reward would be getting higher, and a bad reward would be falling down. Now the most optimal thing to do here is to run hundreds of instances at the same time and pick out the best agent, then we spawn a 100 more with the same neural network as last generation&#39;s winner and we repeat this process.</p><p>This algorithm will not use any external libraries, everything willen we written in pure C# but can be put in any other language.</p><h2 id="the-algorithm-in-understandable-language" tabindex="-1">The algorithm in &quot;understandable language&quot; <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-algorithm-in-understandable-language" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><h3 id="setup" tabindex="-1">Setup: <a class="header-anchor" href="#setup" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>We first define some good rewards and some bad rewards, if my agent was a human child that would certainly hurt my wallet.
