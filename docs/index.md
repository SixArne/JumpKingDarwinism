# JumpKingAI

This research project will be about the evolutionary algorithm, in this short paper I will attempt to 
recreate the jumpking game and add an AI to the agent, the end goal for this AI is to beat the level in an
optimal manner.

## About jumpking

For those that don't know jumpking, jumpking is a rage game where the players controls a simple agent that has to
jump to make it to the top of the map where he can acquire "the Babe".

### Controls

The controls are fairly simple, the player can:

- Jump
- Move left and right
- Jump left or right

It might seem like easy controls but by holding down the space bar the player winds up a jump, but there is no
visual feedback on how long the player has held the key, making it difficult to remember how long a key
has to be held to make a jump.

On top of all that the player can also bounce of a wall when he hits it.
